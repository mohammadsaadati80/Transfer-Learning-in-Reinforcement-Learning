# What is Box in openAI gym?
# Box means that you are dealing with real valued quantities.
#
# The first array np.array([-1,0,0] are the lowest accepted values,
# and the second np.array([+1,+1,+1]) are the highest accepted values.
# In this case (using the comment) we see that we have 3 available actions:
#
# Steering: Real valued in [-1, 1]
# Gas: Real valued in [0, 1]
# Brake: Real valued in [0, 1]

# gym.spaces.Box: A (possibly unbounded) box in  ùëÖ^ùëõ .
# Specifically, a Box represents the Cartesian product of n closed intervals.
# Each interval has the form of one of [a, b], (-oo, b], [a, oo), or (-oo, oo).
# Example: A 1D-Vector or an image observation can be described with the Box space.
#
# # Example for using image as input:
# observation_space = spaces.Box(low=0, high=255,
#                                shape=(HEIGHT, WIDTH, N_CHANNELS),
#                                dtype=np.uint8)
